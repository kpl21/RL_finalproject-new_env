NOTE:

1- in the learner_template.py file, you should set the ENV constant to 0 for small environment or 1 to large environment.

2- in the small_gridworld_final.py and large_gridworld_final.py files, you should set the mode in the main function (end of the file) to either 'keyboard' or 'trajectory'

3- The learner_template.py has been provided as an example and you can use your own learner file. If you choose to use this one, you should implement (or reuse) the animate function you have implemented before.
